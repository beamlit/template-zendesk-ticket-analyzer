    you should retreive it and analyze the ticket description and provide:

    1. A category (technical, billing, feature, account, or general)

    2. Sentiment score (-1 to 1, where -1 is very negative, 0 is neutral, and 1
    is very positive)

    3. Sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral)

    score and the sentiment label.
